# Exploring Deepfake Integration in Augmented Reality for Enhancing Visitor Immersion in Museum Environments

## Overview
This thesis explores the potential of deepfake technology in combination with augmented reality (AR) to enhance visitor immersion in museum environments. Traditional text-based exhibits often struggle to engage modern audiences, prompting a search for innovative approaches. The developed prototype incorporates a deepfake model of Willem of Orange Nassau into an AR application, creating an interactive and realistic experience from a static artwork.

## Key Contributions
- Developed a prototype that integrates deepfake technology with AR to enhance the immersive experience of museum visitors.
- Conducted a comparative experimental study with 100 participants to assess the prototype against traditional text-based displays.
- Evaluated immersion, emotional attachment, and usability using a 7-point Likert-scale questionnaire.

## Results
The study found that deepfake technology in AR can significantly enhance visitor immersion and emotional impact, although it does not necessarily improve usability compared to traditional text-based experiences.

## Prototype Evaluation
To test and use the developed prototype, you can access the following link([Access the Prototype](https://y2e76.zappar.io/5429005348798520342/2.1/)) or scan the QR code:

### Instructions
1. Upon accessing the link, provide consent to use your camera and sensors.
2. Your camera will be activated. Point your camera towards the portrait of Willem of Orange Nassau.
3. Interact with the AR environment using the on-screen buttons to play, replay, mute, or skip the deepfake model.

### System Requirements
- A functional internet connection.
- A compatible mobile device (iPhone 6S or newer, iPad Air 2 or newer, Android devices from 2016 or newer).
- Recommended web browsers: Safari (version 11.3+), Firefox (version 51+).
- Operational camera and touch screen.
- Audio output for enhanced engagement.

## Ethical Considerations
The research ensures the ethical implementation of deepfake technology by using verified historical information and focusing on responsible and accurate representations.
